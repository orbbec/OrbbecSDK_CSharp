# Orbbec SDK C# Wrapper

This is a wrapper for the Orbbec SDK for C#. It provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for accessing the Orbbec camera and performing various operations such as capturing depth images, color images, and performing point cloud generation.

The v2-main branch, C# Wrapper is based the open source version of [Orbbec SDK v2](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_v2). The C# wrapper for the open-source [Orbbec SDK v2](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK_v2) is versioned as v2.x.x, while the C# wrapper for the [Orbbec SDK v1](https://github.com/orbbec/OrbbecSDK) is versioned as v1.x.x.
